## **Description**


<p>&nbsp;</p>

This project is a platform game, in which you will have to overcome a series of obstacles and enemies until you reach the final boss, where you will have to fight against him.

In the game there will also be coins to collect and objects that will allow you to perform certain actions.

## **Characters**


<p>&nbsp;</p>

The main character is the **Pink Girl**, which is the one you control.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


There are 3 enemies types: **Goblin**, **Slime** y **Mushroom**.

Both of them make a pre-established route from one point on the map to another and if the main character collides with them, it will be damage.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


Finally, there is a final boss: **The Minotaur**.

This enemy will follow the main character until he is close enough to hit him.

After each hit, he will have to recover energy, so it will take a few seconds to follow the enemy again.
